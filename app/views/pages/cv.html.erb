<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3 class="cv">June 2005 to Present - Contractor (UK) / Technical Manager (Australia) / Senior Developer (UK) - Hometrack Data Systems</h3>
<p>What initially started out as a short term contract before returning to Australia, turned out to be one of those rare opportunities that allows one explore all facets and challenges of being part of a successful technology start up. I have been involved in all of the products, be they in housing intelligence, corporate or lending solutions at all stages of the SDL and beyond.</p>

<p>After having relocated to Australia and spent some time working on UK based products for Hometrack UK, the company started exploring the option to open an Australian office and I was tasked with porting the UK Automated Valuation Model and Desktop valuation tools to the Australian market. Not only were rapid development iterations and release cycles to meet market demands required, but data sourcing and importing for both sets of products relied heavily on regular housing data and geo spatial data updates (which translated to 1TB of raw data imports from multiple sources every month). In addition, I assisted with the set up of the Australian business, the infrastructure that delivered the solutions, was responsible for the monthly releases and became a key member in the sales process by providing technical support during tenders and client interactions.</p>

<p>Over the course of just a couple of years, we had grown from nothing to a successful business that was able to boast B2B links with most of the major Australian lenders and Mortgage Insurers. The challenges, depth, variety, as well as successes have been a career highlight. I am now back in the UK, where I continue to assists with the delivery of Australian products to facilitate the on-going hand over to local staff, but am gradually getting more involved in the delivery of UK products.</p>

<p>I was responsible for driving the development process, helping define coding standards and educate the team members in sound development processes based on the DSDM agile development methodology and introducing ColdFusion development frameworks (FB4 and Mach-II).</p>

<p>In terms of application development, I was principally involved in developing ColdFusion based intranet applications that would facilitate the migration to the new business management solutions. Furthermore I was involved with designing and implementing a new Oracle based Intranet/Portal application. This solution allowed for a single-sign-on into 4 business applications as well as a flash remoting/ColdFusion/Java based dash board, which displayed current CRM, workflow and financial information to users with appropriate access rights for 2000 global users. All applications were built using the Mach-ii framework.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am dynamic, curious, engaging, thorough and conscientious. I know a lot about many things, but I am always in awe of how much more there is to know. Some call this a Jack of all trades and master of none, though I prefer to be considered a generalist with many interests. I enjoy problem solving and gaining a thorough understanding of the subject matters at hand.</p>

<p>I tend to become the go to guy, to bounce ideas off and discuss technical challenges. I do not actively seek out leadership roles, but they have a tendency to find me. I do not shy away from the responsibility, on the contrary I thrive in it. I consider myself extremely fortunate, that my job also happens to be my hobby.</p>

<p>I try to learn one new programming language a year. Last year it was Groovy and this year I am returning to Ruby. To keep myself sane I work on a few smaller projects that get re-written in the language of the year. I also try to continuously keep improving my tool set and encourage change.</p>

<p>Now that I am back in Europe I really want to find a role that will allow me to use, in addition to my technical skills and experience, my language skills. I have been somewhat frustrated over the years about my knowledge of French and German always being considered an asset, but never been put to good used. This is something I would really like to address.</p>

<p>When I am not spending time with my new family, writing code, reading, thinking of blog posts or contemplating a bike ride, I can be found online playing games.</p>
